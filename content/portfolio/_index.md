Welcome to my portfolio.  
I build systems that connect **design, data, and automation** — tools that make complex processes more intelligent, predictable, and scalable across the AEC tech stack.

Each project below represents a piece of that goal. Some started as small utilities, others became frameworks used across teams. Together they reflect how I approach design technology: technically deep, but grounded in how people actually work.
