I like it when tools make the design *clearer*, not noisier.

This is a small slice of how I approach data centers: take the logic we use every day (program, constraints, redundancy, flows), make it explicit, then let automation do the repetitive part. It’s not about “AI magic.” It’s simple rules, modeled in a way that can evolve.

### The idea
- **Inputs**: program targets, site limits, tier, IT load  
- **Strategies**: cooling and power, sized to the program  
- **Layout logic**: generate data halls, corridors, mechanical yard (chillers), electrical yard (generators), and support zones  
- **Output**: geometry blocks you can place, revise, and re-run

**Why do this?**  
Because it turns “tribal knowledge” into something we can test, share, and improve. If the program changes, you re-run it. If a rule is wrong, you fix the rule—once.

**Facility-level view** (high-level flow: program → strategies → layout → baked geometry)

{{ dynamo_viewer(meta="data/dynamo/datacenter/dc_meta_facility_level.json", io="data/dynamo/datacenter/dc_io_facility_level.json", id="dc-facility") }}

What you’re seeing: the *structure* of the generator, not the secret sauce.

- Program + site → cooling & power strategies  
- Strategies feed a layout generator  
- Generator places **data halls**, **corridors**, **mech yard (chillers)**, **elec yard (generators)**, **support**  
- Then it bakes the geometry

**Zoomed-in demo** (smaller example to show the pattern without all the parts)

{{ dynamo_viewer(meta="data/dynamo/datacenter/dc_meta_simplified.json", io="data/dynamo/datacenter/dc_io_simplified.json", id="dcgen-simple") }}

Same pattern, fewer blocks. Enough to see how inputs move through decisions into geometry.

### What this enables
- **Faster iteration**: change a number, re-run, see the impact  
- **Consistency**: rules live in code, not in someone’s memory  
- **Focus**: teams spend time on *decisions*, not clicking through the same steps  
- **Change**: as needs shift, the logic updates and the outputs follow

This is the kind of work I like—practical automation that helps teams ship better designs with less guesswork.
