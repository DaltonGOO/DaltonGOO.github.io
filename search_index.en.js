Back to Blog | Home\nI’ve been trying to make sense of why design technology inside AE (Architecture and Engineering) firms feels the way it does. Not broken, but kind of… stitched together. A script here, a checklist there, a dashboard someone made two years ago that barely connects to anything else. We keep layering tools on top of tools, and somehow expect that to solve deeper problems.\nWhat I keep coming back to is this:\nAE is trying to build modern systems with a mindset that wasn’t designed for modern systems.\nAnd I don’t mean that in a dramatic way..maybe a little. It’s just how the industry evolved. We train architects and engineers to think in terms of deliverables, not tech systems. So when firms try to adopt technology, they naturally approach it the same way: project by project, tool by tool, fix by fix.\nBut underlying real systems don’t work like that.\n\nWho’s building the system layer?\nSomething I’ve been thinking about a lot is that the design-tech architecture inside firms shouldn’t be built only by people who grew up in the industry. They should be involved, obviously. But you also need people who think in terms of modularity, platforms, ecosystems, and long-term maintainability.\nWithout that balance, the tech environment ends up exactly how it is today:\nreactionary, fragmented, and inconsistent.\nAE doesn’t have technology systems.\nIt has a lot of tools, but not much in the way of an underlying system. Those tools are often not connected, not coherent, and not designed to really grow.\nThat’s why workflows feel brittle. It’s not that the tech can’t support something better but it’s that the architecture behind the tech doesn’t really exist.\n\nModular, adaptable systems\nWhen I’ve built AE-type agents and modular architectures (primarily around programming languages), one thing I noticed showing up:\nIf you design something modular, you don’t have to predict everything.\nYou build what you know, and the structure supports what you don’t know yet.\nAnyone can extend it.\nAnyone can plug into it.\nChange becomes normal instead of painful.\nBut that requires a certain culture: trust, empowerment, willingness to let people adapt systems to their own workflows. A lot of firms aren’t there yet.\n\nAgents as a different kind of system\nMost firms try to keep knowledge alive by recording videos, writing documentation, or building searchable libraries. Those are fine, but they’re static. As soon as a process changes, the “library” just gets bigger, not better.\nAgents force you to codify the process itself like the logic, dependencies, priorities, and context that make the work what it is. Once captured, it can evolve. It can adapt. It can tell you what matters and what doesn’t. It becomes a living thing.\nThat’s the part that feels modern to me but also more aligned with how people actually work.\nNot endless how-to recordings,\nbut systems that actually reflect how the work happens.\nThis certainly requires a structured approach, and I think it’s a good recent example of what Calm Technology is aiming for. Technology that works even when it fails. Technology that stays in the background and only comes to the foreground when needed. Technology that adapts to the user, not the other way around.\nI am not saying AI agents are the answer to everything. But they do represent a different way of thinking about how tools can work. Not as a static thing, but as a adaptable system that evolves with the work.\n\nA bigger idea: technology that behaves more like a living system\nAE loves the idea of standards. We have so many “standards” that it basically means we have none. Every new rule creates new friction. Every “fix” creates a new layer of complexity.\nBut what if technology behaved more like the brain? Bear with me here. I get that might sound out there.\n\nYou add something new → it reorganizes.\nYou remove something → it smooths the gap.\nYou change inputs → it rewires and keeps going.\n\nLLMs and agent workflows are the closest we’ve seen to tech that adapts with us:\n\ntools that learn your habits\ntools that “understand” context\ntools that evolve instead of demand configuration\ntools that feel more like collaborators than strict systems \n\nI am not saying no structure but one where structure emerges instead of being imposed.\nIt’s a weird idea, but I think it matters. Again LLMs and agents aren’t perfect, but they hint at a different way of thinking about technology in AE. Not as rigid systems we have to bend around, but as fluid systems that adapt to how we work. I think with the right underlying structure and mindset, AE could start building tech environments that feel less chaotic and more like a natural extension of the work itself.\n\nFrictionless, fluid, close to thought\nDesign tech should feel like a natural extension of how people think: fluid, adaptive, responsive. Not something rigid we have to bend around.\nI don’t think AE is there today. But I don’t think this is futuristic. We’re already seeing glimpses of it in LLMs, agents, adaptive interfaces, modular libraries, and how people are experimenting in tech.\nOne framework I keep coming back to is a principle from Calm Technology:\nTechnology should work even when it fails.\nThat’s the kind of environment AE needs.\nNot perfect. Not brittle. Not over-engineered.\nJust systems that support the work, evolve with the work, and reduce friction instead of creating it.\nMaybe none of this solves everything. But it feels like the direction worth exploring.\nAt least, this is where my head’s been at lately.\n← Back to Blog | Home\n","id":"https://daltongoo.github.io/blog/sbta-how-aec-builds-its-systems/","title":"Something I’ve Been Thinking About: How AE Builds Its Design Technology Systems"},"https://daltongoo.github.io/blog/what-revit-does-not-show/":{"body":"← Back to Blog | Home\nFrom Revit’s opaque model data to explorable structures that let us see how our models actually work. We will get an understanding of model logic to build smarter automation in this post.\nRevit does a good job of showing you what you built but not what your model is.\nWhen I started pulling data out of models, I wasn’t looking for KPIs or dashboards. I wanted to understand how things connect. Which systems talk to which, and which families matter. Even something as small as how an object interacts with rooms or spaces can reveal how consistently data is captured. Once you understand what’s reliable (and what isn’t), you can start writing rules around it.\nOver the years I built dozens of dashboards. They looked nice, but they didn’t really explain much. They just showed more data.\nIt took me a little to realize the problem isn’t that we don’t have enough data. It’s that we don’t understand how our workflows connect to it.\nHow we interact with our tools shapes what we see and what we fail to see.\nI once spent days digging into electrical “room insertion” logic. That single investigation led to tools that survive messy modeling and still produce trustworthy data.\nIt’s easy to treat solutions as limited by the tools themselves. Most learn just enough to get through a project, check the boxes, and make the model “work.” But I think there is a lot of value that comes from curiosity. Asking why the model behaves the way it does and what its structure reveals about how we work.\nTo create real value for clients and teams, we have to move past “use the same tools the same way.” We can automate, analyze, and connect data across portfolios yet so much time still disappears into warnings and chasing “perfect” 2D drawings.\nWe can build systems that learn from our projects.\nWe can capture knowledge, not just geometry.\n\nExtracted structure\nHere’s some raw model data as an explorable tree. Interacting with it exposes relationships and hierarchies how the model thinks, not just how it looks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the same data as a network graph. Each line is a dependency; each node is a system, element type, or space. This is how models behave.\n\n\n\n  Relationships: Systems ⇆ Ducts/Equipment; Equipment ⇆ Spaces; Ducts ⇆ Equipment (ConnectedTo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a 3D preview of that dataset. Once you lift model data into a flexible structure, you can inspect it spatially, logically, or relationally and you get much closer to diagnostics or automated correction.\n\n\n\n  Left-drag: orbit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy these visuals matter\nOnce the wiring is visible, patterns and inconsistencies can start to appear.\nAnd when you can see structure, you can write rules.\nVisualization can allow you to see the relationships between data and automation.\nYou move from “what is wrong?” to “what can I do about it?” which opens up what I think are interesting possibilities.\nInstead of reacting to problems, you can begin to anticipate them, having systems that understand the intent behind a model, not just its outputs.\n\nWho benefits\nThis isn’t just for “tech people.” Designers, BIM managers, and even owners can use these views to ask better questions:\n\nWhy is this system connected that way?\nWhat drives that parameter?\nIs the model behaving how we think it is?\n\nOnce the logic becomes visible, the model stops being a static file and can start acting like a living system that can evolve and adapt.\n\nFrom visuals to autonomy\nMost “model health” tools stop at telling you something’s wrong. That can be useful but not really that impactful.\nInstead of simple data reporting, we can build a system that knows what to do with what it sees.\nIf a duct is disconnected, I don’t need a chart.\nI need a system that recognizes the condition and applies a logical reconnection, taking into account design phase, intent, and tolerance.\nVisualization can help us discover patterns.\nAutomation helps us respond to them.\nTogether, they form the foundation of what I think of as autonomous interpretation a model that can explain and improve itself.\nRevit doesn’t make these relationships easy to see, but when you pull the data out, you can start to understand the model’s logic directly.\n\nGuiding ideas\n\nVisuals for exploration.\nAutomation for intent-aware action.\nHuman-in-the-loop by default.\nTraceability.\n\n\nWhat “autonomous” looks like\nConditionVisual cueAutonomous action\nOrphan duct connectorShow orphan endpointsPropose shortest valid reconnection honoring clearance/slope; preview Δlength\nMissing parameterColor by family/fieldAuto-fill from dictionary or prompt once\nClearance violationShow conflict graphMinimal-nudge reroute with system priority\nSpace type mismatchColor by space typePropose reassignment based on dictionary or vector similarity\n\n\nFrom a tiny rule to a chain of reasoning\nEven a small piece of logic like a simple rule can become the foundation for intelligent behavior.\nYou start with a condition, define a response, then let patterns scale that response across models.\nThe code below can be directly executed in jupyter notebook or any python environment to demonstrate the concept of autonomous model interpretation.\n\nEach small rule feeds into a broader system of data → structure → automation.\nData defines what exists, structure defines how it connects, and automation defines how it adapts.\nThat loop observe → interpret → act is how design tools start becoming intelligent collaborators rather than just containers of messy data.\nOnce that foundation exists, automation stops being a collection of one-off scripts or reports and the need for “BIM cops” disappears It becomes a feedback system one that learns from your models, reinforces good behavior, and can even flag weak patterns before they turn into rework.\nWhen you go past the surface of your tools, you gain visibility and agency. And automation starts to amplify your decisions instead of hiding them behind black boxes.\n\n\n\n  \n    Data → Structure → Automation\n    ready\n    \n      Play\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Data\n      Structure\n      Automation\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        Reconnect orphan ducts\n        0\n      \n      \n        Fill missing SystemName\n        0\n      \n      \n        Normalize tags\n        0\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Ducts\n      Equipment\n      Spaces\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short:\nWhen you expose model data, you expose logic.\nWhen you structure it, you gain insight.\nWhen you automate with that insight, you get tools that understand what they’re helping you build.\n← Back to Blog | Home\n","id":"https://daltongoo.github.io/blog/what-revit-does-not-show/","title":"What Revit Does Not Show You"},"https://daltongoo.github.io/portfolio/":{"body":"Home\nWelcome to my portfolio.\nI build systems that connect design, data, and automation — tools that make complex processes more intelligent, predictable, and scalable across the AEC tech stack.\nEach project below represents a piece of that goal.
